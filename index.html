        <h3>What's fqrouter Vision</h3>

        <p>It is a software designed to help you by-pass Great Firewall of China (GFW). Different from similar
            softwares, it is designed to run as router instead of running as a client installed on some device.
            Being router means, you can have one thing (Android mobile phone, for example) running fqrouter,
            then other devices can just connect the wireless network created by fqrouter.
            Those devices can enjoy all the benefits provided without worrying about how it is being implemented.
            The unique feature fqrouter provides is to be able to start the wifi hotspot without breaking existing wifi
            connection,
            this technology is known as wifi-repeater, and it has never been implemented before on Android mobile.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, not all android mobile phones in use supports "wifi-repeating", especially those old models.
            To help those users, there two sub-optimal solutions. First, if mobile is using 3G connection, wifi
            hotspot can be started using the system default method (wifi just for hotspot, no repeating required).
            Second, fqrouter can list all the other devices in the same wifi network, and "pick & play". Device being
            picked will be redirected to a new gateway, which allows it to surf free internet via fqrouter.
        </p>

        <p>Besides the unique "router" proposition, fqrouter also features several ways to by-pass GFW, and combine all
            those methods together as a best solution. The biggest highlight is there are ways to access a lot of
            blocked websites without the help of server or proxy. Although the method alone can not allow you to access
            ALL blocked websites (ip blocked is no luck), it can be combined with other by-pass technologies,
            such as uni-directional proxy or traditional SSH/VPN to make a complete solution. The fallback from "direct
            access" to "via proxy" happens automatically, you even do not need to refresh the browser.

        <h3>Current Status</h3>

        <p>fqrouter is not ready for its prime time yet. We are working on these things concurrently: </p>
        <h4>GFW By-passs Methods</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>[90%] No Proxy: NIDS injection attack, for websites without ip/port blocked</li>
            <li>[90%] No Proxy: hosted domain resolving not blocked ip, just for google.com</li>
            <li>[90%] Public Full proxy: via public/free https proxy (proxy both upstream and downstream)</li>
            <li>[70%] Public/Private Full proxy: via goagent (http only, appid from <a
                    href="http://code.google.com/p/gfanqiang/">gfanqiang</a>)
            </li>
            <li>[00%] Private Full proxy: via SSH</li>
            <li>[00%] Private Full proxy: via shadowsocks</li>
            <li>[00%] Private Full proxy: via SPDY</li>
            <li>[00%] Half Proxy (proxy only upstream)</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Free Internet Sharing Methods</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>[80%] Share as "Wifi Repeater" (Hardware support required)</li>
            <li>[00%] Share using system wifi hotspot (only feasible in 3G environment)</li>
            <li>[00%] Pick & Play: let other devices in same wifi network surf free internet via fqrouter (No hardware
                support required)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>fqrotuer project was started as a ROM for <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n">tplink-wr703n</a>,
            a mini wireless router capable of running 3rd party OS <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>.
            At that time, I did not believe it is possible to make Android mobile phone as wireless router. But after
            the discovery of ways to start
            wifi hotspot concurrently with normal wifi connection on Android phones, the development focus then shifted
            from OpenWRT to Android.
            However, the support of OpenWRT is still on my radar, home wifi-router running OpenWRT is still the best
            platform for infrastructure deployment, such as Home/Office.

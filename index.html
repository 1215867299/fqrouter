        <h3>What's fqrouter Vision</h3>

<p>It is a software designed to help you by-pass Great Firewall of China (GFW). Different from similar softwares, it is designed to run as router instead of running as a client installed on some device. 
Being router means, you can have one thing (Android mobile phone, for example) running fqrotuer, 
then other devices can just connect the wireless network created by fqrotuer. 
Those devices can enjoy all the benefits provided without worrying about how it is being implemented.
  The unique feature fqrouter provides is to be able to start the wifi hotspot without breaking existing wifi connection,
  this technology is known as wifi-repeater, and it has not been implemeneted before on Android mobile.
</p>
      <p>Besides the unique "router" proposition, fqrouter also features several ways to by-pass GFW. Especially there are ways to access a lot of blocked websites without the help of server or proxy. 
        Although the method alone can not allow you access ALL blocked websites (ip blocked is no luck), it can be
        combined with other by-pass technologies, such as uni-directional proxy or traditional SSH/VPN to make a complete solution.

        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>fqrouter is not ready for its prime time yet. We are working on these things concurrently: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>[10%] Blocking Detector: tell you why you can not access xxx (replace xxx with your favourite website), 
          also tells you if fqrouter is actually working</li>
          <li>[40%] Wifi Hotspot: turn your mobile into a wifi router</li>
          <li>[90%] GFW By-pass without server/proxy help</li>
          <li>[ 0%] GFW By-pass with uni-directional proxy</li>
          <li>[ 0%] GFW by-pass with tranditional proxy: SSH/VPN etc.</li>
        </ol>
